However, I would like to see myself heading in the direction towards becoming an IT Business Analyst or a similar job in the tech industry.    </td>

                <th>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</th>
                <td>I find it fascinating to see just how much technology is used in our daily lives and how rapidly it has evolved. With a few simple clicks you can figure out how to get to where you’re going using the PTV app and listen to multiple songs on Spotify or read your favourite books using Kindle. I think my interest in IT began when there were so apps coming out, for example Angry Birds or Candy Crush that had a pretty basic concept behind it however, it got audiences so amused and addicted. So I was curious on the behind the scenes of what it took to create such an app. I chose to come to Rmit because I wanted to enter the realm of technology and what better university to allow that to happen than the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Since I have no prior experience in this field, it would be an incredible opportunity to learn about the behind the scenes of how things like websites and apps are created. For example, how to best satisfy the target audience or how to create the codes for programs. </td>
